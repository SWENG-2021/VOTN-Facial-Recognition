## Deployment file

You can find the details on how to install the software in the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/SWENG-2021/VOTN-Facial-Recognition/blob/main/GettingStarted.md)

You do not have to worry about the software dependecies, but you will be able to see them in the install.sh file (all the libraries and necessary programs installed):

`FFmpeg`, `python3`, `nginx`, `cmake`, `face_recognition`, `scikit-build`, `python opencv`, `gunicorn`, `frameioclient`, `flask`.
